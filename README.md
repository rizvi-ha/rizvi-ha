# Hi, Iâ€™m Hassan Rizvi, a 4th-year CS student at UCLA
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m broadly interested in software reliability, software architecture, systems programming, embedded programming, robotics and much much more
  
- ðŸ“˜ In my free time I'm currently studying Mandarin, neuroscience, gardening, and the best restaurants in LA

Many of my personal projects and experiments live on this page. Feel free to check some of them out! (Be kind, some are still in-progress)
